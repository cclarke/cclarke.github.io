      I am a second-year PhD candidate in Philosophy at New York University.
      Right now I'm thinking mostly about causation, causal inference, and
      causal modeling, as well as issues around explanation and ontology in
      social science and social theory. I have additional interests in social,
      ethical, and political issues surrounding technology and computation, and
      in the history of Black social and political thought.

      I completed an AB at Harvard University in 2017, with a joint concentration in
      Philosophy and African & African American Studies and a secondary field
      in Computer Science. On the way to this degree I also completed
      coursework and research in statistics and signal processing.

      From 2017 to 2019 I enjoyed a professional career as a data scientist
      and data engineer at Civis Analytics. I did a lot of computer
      programming during this time, and continue to program as a hobbyist as
      well as for personal productivity. Iâ€™m particularly interested right
      now in scientific computing (including probabilistic programming),
      document formatting and typesetting, and programming language design.

      Outside of philosophy, I love music and enjoy being outdoors.

          In fall 2019 I will enter the PhD program in Philosophy at NYU.
          I’m interested in value theory, with topical interests in law, policy,
          technology, social science, and social theory. Some questions I'm
          currently thinking about are:
          <ul>
            <li>legal, political, and mathematical considerations about political and racial gerrymandering;
            <li>questions of morality and institutional design arising from behavioral economics; and
            <li>the moral and legal status of autonomous and artificially intelligent agents.
          </ul>
        </p>

          I completed an AB at Harvard in 2017, with a joint concentration in
          Philosophy and African & African American Studies and a secondary field
          in Computer Science. On the way to this degree I also completed
          coursework and research in statistics and signal processing.

          From 2017 to 2019 I enjoyed a professional career as a data scientist
          and data engineer at Civis Analytics. I did a lot of computer
          programming during this time, and continue to program as a hobbyist as
          well as for personal productivity. I’m particularly interested right
          now in scientific computing (including probabilistic programming),
          document formatting and typesetting, and programming language design.

          I love music and enjoy being outside.

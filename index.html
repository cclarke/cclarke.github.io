    <p>
      I'm a second-year PhD candidate in Philosophy at New York University.
      I have primary interests in logic, language, computation, and artificial intelligence; 
      social, ethical, and political issues surrounding computing technology; 
      and the history of Black social and political thought.
    </p>

    <p>
      I completed an AB at Harvard University in 2017, with a joint concentration in
      Philosophy and African & African American Studies and a secondary field
      in Computer Science. On the way to this degree I also completed
      coursework and research in statistics and signal processing.

      Before graduate school I enjoyed a professional career as a data scientist
      and data engineer. I continue to use skills I picked up in that setting both for work and for fun.
      I'm particularly interested right now in scientific computing,
      document formatting and typesetting, and programming language design.
    </p>

    <p>
      Outside of philosophy, I love music and enjoy being outdoors.
